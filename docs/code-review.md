Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive code review of this IMAP backup tool codebase. The review covered all the requested areas and found this to be an exceptionally well-engineered Go application.

## Key Findings:

**Overall Assessment: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)**

This codebase represents a **reference-quality implementation** with:

- **Exceptional Security**: Comprehensive input validation, path traversal protection, secure TLS configuration, and proper sanitization
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Clean modular design with proper separation of concerns
- **Robust Error Handling**: Structured error management with graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimization**: Worker pools, memory limits, and incremental backups
- **Quality Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing, linting, and SonarQube integration

The code demonstrates mature engineering practices with security-first design principles. The minor technical debt items (like using MD5 instead of SHA-256 for checksums) are cosmetic and don't impact the overall excellent quality.

This is exactly the kind of codebase you'd want to see in a production environment handling sensitive email data - secure, well-tested, and maintainable.
